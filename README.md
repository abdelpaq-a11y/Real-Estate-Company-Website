# Real Estate - Local Static Site

This is a small static website for a real-estate company with simple structure.

## Structure
```
real-estate/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── projects.html
├── project-green-golf.html
├── contact.html
└── assets/
    ├── css/styles.css
    ├── js/script.js
    └── img/ (placeholders)
```

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a static server).
2. To enable EmailJS contact form:
   - Create an account on https://www.emailjs.com
   - Set your Service ID, Template ID and Public Key in the script (the project already uses the keys you provided).
3. Replace images in `assets/img` with your real images (keep filenames or update HTML accordingly).
